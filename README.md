### Welcome to my dotfiles repo!

Recently I decided to step up my game and to rice my current Arch + i3 install.

So for the past 2 months I've been writing scripts, testing configs, and looking at r/unixporn a little too often üòâ

I will be including a few screenshots of some different programs so that you can see what everything looks like!
